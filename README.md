# Idea Generator
****

Generate ideas for your next project. Or, you can just generate random words.
Note that this module supports both Typescript and Javascript.

## Examples:

Typescript 
```ts
import { idea } from 'https://deno.land/x/idea/mod.ts'

console.log(await idea())
```

Javascript
```js
import { idea } from 'https://deno.land/x/idea/mod.ts'

console.log(await idea())
```

## Contributing

You can contribute to this module by adding more words to the list!
Just create a pull request for [ideas.txt](https://github.com/NotSyntax/idea/blob/master/ideas.txt).

All you have to do is to write new words.
These words should not have spaces, and only one should appear on each line.
